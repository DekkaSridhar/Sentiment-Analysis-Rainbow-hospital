With that great talk which we heard we went with great expectations. BUT,Our experience with Rainbow hospitals was very much discouraging specially because of the general pediatric doctor (Dr. Y ANUPAMA) who could not hear nor pay complete attention to our concerns and when we try to explain the problems she was responding back saying ""I'm not here to solve sherlock home puzzles"". As a doctor is this the answer we should hear? We share our problems with an expectation that doctor will hear and give us hope and right direction towards the problem we shared and NOT discourage us with such responses. She doesn't have listening skills to hear us out and cutting our talk and jumping the guns to early. Very much disappointed about this doctor where with her lack of abelites she is ruining the reputation of the hospital. We understood that this doctor has no patience to hear, not willing to answer all our questions and her knowledge and experience towards the children's subject might be very limited were she can only handle the cases like fever, cold, cough and flu and hence she was not willing to hear and address the issues we shared with much attention.We however took a second opinion of the senior doctor and she was really great in hearing us out and guiding us through the right way. We were happy and filled with hope when we could meet the experienced doctor for second opinion. We are rating low because of the first doctor who doesn't have experience or subject knowledge or lack of patience to hear us out. Hence rating our experience very poor.

Later I checked the insurance app and found that 3 pm itself Insurance company sent the final approval. Again visited insurance desk, waited, waited, showed the insurance mail, now they realised their mistake and accepted they got approval 2 hours ago. Now things are not yet over.... Insurance desk help staff said ""sir..go to next counter"". Again waited, waited in next counter. Finally got the final bill.Over all the discharge experience is not so satisfying, Even though my insurance company approved final bill on time,  I was made to shuttling between Nursing station <--> Insurance desk <--> Billing deskDischarge experience is 2 out of 5Even though overall Rainbow hospital experience was so good.experience at insurance counter, make things not so satisfying.Hope somebody at Rainbow Hospital reading these reviews and act upon, so they become BETTER to BESTMy Overall rating is 4 out of 5(reduced 1 star, due to insurance desk experience)",4.0,Telangana 500034,a month ago

It was a lot more than I expected.What's more, they seem to care a lot about money and not so much about taking care of patients. It made me feel a bit sad.I also found out that they charge 25% more for things that aren't related to surgery.

When I asked why ultrasound is required she it's upto you whether you take it or not. Ultimately they convinced me and charged 3k which was not all required.So if they bill for 41000 for just vomittings and if it is a real serious issue how much they are going to bill.

Dr. Satyanarayan Reddy is a good pediatrician who at least checks the baby with the help of a stethoscope and explains things well.Other OP doctors hardly spend a few minutes and all they do is listen to our points and prescribe medicines.Especially Mr Chandra Sekhar who was very rude to us. Why become peadtrician when u cannot empathize with concerned parents.While this as such is a sorry state we had to admit our daughter last week and the admission experience was pathetic. Even a local clinic would have tended better.1. The emergency doctor Mr. Laxmikant. He doesn't even have time to physically take exactly 5 steps and examine the x ray. He asked the nurse to get the x-ray photographed and sent over WhatsApp.2. The nurses in the night shift are so horrible. There are no nurses who specialise in infants and everyone is a general nurse. Particularly one nurse Udaya who is a general nurse.She is very rude and doesn't try to see why the baby is crying. She even had the audacity to ask us why the baby was crying when she was administered cannula.She doesn't even try to lower her voice when the baby is sleeping which startled and woke the baby multiple times.3. There is absolutely no care or attention even in private room which charges a bomb and is expensive than 90% of 5 star hotels in Hyderabad. Half the drugs, medicines, even nebulization was done by us.

"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Hospital & BirthRight, Hyder Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Phani Subrahmanya,"Here is my personal experiencePROS1. The doctors are good, have to be genuine in this case (5 star only for this point)CONS2. The hospital charged me 10,000 for sanitization but, meanwhile Cockroaches are playing around the new born baby and our ""Private room"".3. The response time is slow, I had to inform the 4th floor emergency team 10 times for 2 days continuously to make them remove the ""Epidural cord"" after moving my wife to normal room.4. THE INSURANCE TEAM at -1 floor are PATHETIC. They doesn't know basic manners!! I think Rainbow has to teach them basic common sense on how to talk to the patients who opt for cashless/ask questions regarding Insurance claims.5. The Insurance team, there is a female who don't give a damn to the question you ask! She just don't give attention to the questions you ask, she just gives you random irrelevant answers.I had ask the team to give me details regarding the treatment expenses going on for my new born...she was like""I don't know anything sir, talk to your insurance team i have nothing to tell you, i can't tell you any thing, you deal with your insurance, i can't do or tell anything""6. Inside the Insurance room, the ward people/nurses occupied the chair which is for the attenders of the patients to sit and discuss. They were watching Instagram reels and enjoying, meanwhile i was standing there for 5 minutes long to get my Query answered, i was not offered the chair, the ward people didn't give a damn!! ZERO PRIVACY TO TALK ABOUT YOUR CONCERN WITH THE INSURANCE TEAM. ZERO RESPECT, ZERO ATTENTION TO YOUR CONCERN, i felt like Government hospital ambience would be far better than the Rainbow's Insurance team.!!!7. Being a private employee of a top big firm and in a better designation than the insurance team, i gave them enough respect but, i didn't get from them. I think Rainbow has to give counselling to the team to know basic manners.8. Billing is not transparent, the Insurance team nor the Hospital team didn't give a piece of information regarding the ""Private room""  or any other treatments or changes made. They just take their own decisions and let you know at the time of billing.I AM GOING TO ESCALATE THE EXPERIENCE TO MY INSURANCE TEAM AND ALSO TO MY FIRM AND I WIL MAKE SURE NONE OF MY FIRM EMPLOYEES ARE OPTING FOR RAINBOW HYDERNAGAR.

Hospital services become like govt hospital. During one of my first scan felt complete plotting by scan doctor and gynecologist doctor. They made us worried about baby NT is not good and recommend for various tests unnecessarily. We have done the NT scan out side another hospital same day evening and that was absolutely fine of 2.4 where Rainbow scan it was 3.3. Felt they are plotting us for going for additional tests and making money as the nurse was also involved in this on scan counter. Very pathetic experience. We moved to other hospital later on to a 22+ years experienced doctor had our delivery as well by now in Yashoda Hitech City. People should be recomend tests when needed not unnecessarily just to make money with high prices, scan doctor behavior was so bad and we can't believe our doctor could not answer our questions as well while asked only told us to meet after doing tests. All doctors are not bad here but money minded and recomend for unnecessarily test.

Visiting charges are at least 900 rupees, blood tests that cost 700 rupees outside will be charged in thousands here, and each ultrasoundreport costs more than 4500 rupees (and you'll need at least three of them, VIP will be given preference in time and common people will be stranded for hours).The doctors are always in a hurry due to the overload of patients. They have no time to explain anything to you, and they have no clear pricing packages. We had to wait for two to three hours to see Dr. Uma Jyothi, even though we had a scheduledappointment.The private delivery rooms are small and expensive ~1.5 lacs Rs. The billing and administrative staff is rude and unprofessional.The parking space iscongested will be forced to park far awayand take your pregnant wife walking a long distance each time.But the worst part of our experience is the pediatrician service with long waiting que, no nursing lady to handle baby for weight, clothing etc. They will charge exorbitantvaccination price, which ars two to three times higher than what we get outside.Overall, Rainbow Children's Hospital, Hydernagar is a rip-off for new parents. They charge exorbitant prices for subpar services. I would strongly advise against taking your child to this hospital.Here are some additional thoughts on the hospital's shortcomings:‚óè The hospital is often overcrowded, and patients have to wait long hours to see a doctor.‚óè The nursing staff is overworked, which can lead to poor patient care.‚óè The hospital is not transparent about its pricing, and patients are often surprised by the high bills they receive.‚óè The hospital has a history of medical negligence toward us.If you are looking for a children's hospital in Hyderabad, I would strongly recommend that you avoid Rainbow Children's Hospital, Hydernagar.

Because of the plasters they put on my kid for more than a week it caused boils on her forehead and it appears really bad now.I have no words to describe the deceit I got from this surgeon.This is an open letter to you Madam:It's not always about money these tiny humans have a life and we all humans have emotions don't make it a business, and doctors should have professional ethics.

Pure corporate/business mindset and looks like he is just bothered on the count of patients he attends in a day, rather than spending and addressing the patients issues. This is no more a hospital, but just a business platform to make money out of it.On the same day, few other parents were also complaining that nurses in the sample collection section are not taking the samples properly, may be due to their negligence or not been well-trained. To take blood sample they are injecting in several places of babies and kids, instead of a single spot.

We had The worst of the worst experience with the treating and non treating staff. Especially we are disgusted over the ER and Dr Vamsi Kiran Raidu. We rushed to the ER as my one month old son suddenly stopped breathing and didn't respond to any of us, the ER after listening to what all happened made us wait for an hour and told that the baby has to be admitted, upon asking what is the problem with the baby the doctor present over there said that we brought over the problem(he said that my son is a problem) and they have to work because of him (we failed to note down his name because of the situation we were then). Baby was shifted to NICU at around 1am, I was allowed to see him just once that night (understanding the so called NICU protocols I didn't put pressure over visiting my son). Next day Dr Vamsi Kiran Raidu was assigned to my son, at the time of consultation, the first words he spoke were what's the problem, we were shocked to hear that question as being a doctor he was supposed to say what he observed from my son's situation as he visited him before the counselling session we had with him, he was rude with his words when we asked the same that he was supposed to tell about my kid's situation. He said that my son had seizures and multiple tests have to be done to find out the reason, we agreed. Through out the 4 days my kid's stay in NICU we were allowed twice a day to see him, on the next counselling we were said that seizures are due to calcium and vitamin deficiency, and followed up with the treatment. But from the day 1 I as a mother I have been saying that my kid has difficulty in breathing as he makes whistling songs and grumpy sounds while breathing, and asked for chest, lungs examination but Dr Vamsi Kiran Raidu rejected it saying that I am over thinking and reminded me that I am not a doctor and he is the one with doctors knowledge. And talking about the NICU treatment, they were so negligent don't know what they were doing while my little one was wiggling and pulling out cannula, till date he has a large lump on back of his hand caused due to sudden pulling, my son has sensitive skin and shows strong reactions to gel diapers I told the staff at NICU not to use gel diapers and I'll provide with cotton diapers but don't know what they did with those diapers I gave they used some unknown diapers and caused him rashes over the bump area, and when I visited the NICU without pre intimation, I saw a pacifier taped to my son's mouth and a nurse sitting over her dsk and my son crying inside due to the irritation of being taped by pacifier.We were glad that the only good thing Rainbow did was assigning multiple specialists and one was the most humble madam sirisha on our visit with endocrinologist madam Sirisha said that baby has cold and phlegm and prescribed nebuliser.We were confused how Dr Vamsi Kiran Raidu refused baby didn't have cold and phlegm and how madam Sirisha said that baby is having cold and phlegm, hence we changed the hospitals.FYI has huge phlegm was deposited in chest and has cold and upon getting treated for it he is completely fineWe were charged 3.5lakhs for 4 days for nothing,According to my knowledge the doctor and hospitals are liable to be filed against for misdiagnosis and ill treating of the patientNever going to step in to Rainbow hospitals again. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",1.0,Telangana 500072,a year ago

Worried parents take time to understand things, if we ask anything again, she yells at you saying how many times do I have to explain. This is not the way parents need to be  treated. We are paying for the consultantation, means we are liable to be informed about kids situation.

We were worried about long term and lasting effects of hypothyroidism in our son, but she explained that as it was detected so early, we could treat it without any side effects or developmental delays whatsoever. True enough, our son is growing up meeting all his milestones. Dr. Kavitha is extremely methodical and has always patiently addressed all our concerns.

I was shocked because I realised right away that this was going to be really difficult for both Gayatri and me because this type of triplet pregnancy carries a significant chance of premature delivery and requires a lot of preparation and money ‚Ä¶.Everyone is thrilled and amazed when I told to my parents, her parents, and family friends.So  I visited lot of reputable hospital in my hometown latur and hyderabad to get some advice about this triplets pregnancyBut almost everyone suggests me and also warn me that it could be very risky and expensive if we continue,So, almost everyone suggested that I have to reduce one baby,But Gayatri has always wanted all of them, so she has completely denied doctors suggestions,and I have concur with her decision because no doctor will proceed for the reduction without her consent.For few days I was fully confused and worried bcs I have to take decisions in very less time so I discussed with my father in law Mr Vinayak Patil (hyderabad)and he told me you have to meet dr Mamta Dindayal mam and follow her instructionsSo I take the appointment and meetDR. Mamata Dindayal,She checked Gayatri and advised me to follow God's will and continue this pregnancy without the necessity for reduction.Then Dr Mamta Mam Called to#DrPrashant CEO of #RainbowhospitalAnd told him handover this case to your best senior doctorThe following day, I received a call from Rainbow Hospital, which informed us that #DrSwapnaPooskuru Mam would be handling our case.Thus, our journey began when we visited the Rainbow Hospital and met Swapna Mam.She regularly monitors Gayatri, offers advice, and records it in her file so there's no need to wait.And the day, August 7, 2022, came.We went to the hospital because Gayatri was in pain, and the doctor informed me that she started labour pain and urgent surgery was required.However, Swapna Mam was not available that day, so Dr. Shanti sree Mam operated on Gayatri, and she gave birth safely.one baby  boy and two baby girlsThree of my babies and their mother are now healthy and in perfect condition after spending eight days in the NICU under the care of #DrvamsireddySo throughout this entire journey,I want to express my sincere gratitude toDr. Mamta Dindayal Mam.#RainbowHospitalHyderabadhydernagarBranch  StaffSpecial thanks to #DrPrashant( to whom I never met)#SwapnaPooskuru Mam#DrShanteeSree Mam#AnandSir#ShilpaMamAnd finally to my soulmate my better-half Gayatri to give me most precious gift of my Life üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüíê",5.0,Telangana 500072,a year ago

The problem starts from the next visit. When we came in the morning to meet Dr Chaitanya Cheeti, we were asked to come in the evening and gave an appointment at 5:30 pm. When we were there by 5:30 and waited till 6:30, we were informed that 3 more patients are waiting. And the waiting will be a nightmare. For the 2 hours of a follow up visit, there are LCDs with 2 contents repeated more than 10 times. It doesn't look like advertisement, it definitely looks like testing patients patience. Don't understand, if the facilities group doesn't have any other information/advertisement to be displayed. Question here is why do they have time slots, when the  time can't be followed for not a regular visit but a follow up visit",3.0,Telangana 500072,a year ago

"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Hospital & BirthRight, Hyder Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",abhilash gujjari,Worst service and worst behaviour. In case of emergency after booking an appointment need to wait for 3-4 hours. Stupidity and careless reception with more person's than the customers in the queue.Need to wait for 1 hour for washroom. Always cleaning board displayed at the entrance of the washroom and door locked from inside. That too 2 washrooms at same time. That's a minimum common sence pragnancy women gets more usage of washroom. How you people named the hospital as children and famous for pragnancy. Even small hospitals maintain customer friendly environment.And my appointment booked at 9AM and waiting till 11AM to consult the doctor. Too much of waiting time. Very disappointed with the facilities.Emergency Admin procedure will take2-3 hours. These people will prepare bed after the patient comes to 4 th floor for emergency admission. This was the worst procedure i have seen ever.Dear friends.I never recommend this type of hospitals for children. Dr vamshi is a worst doctor and not even do the check-ups of the baby. Simply he recommends to join in emergency ward. Fully commercial hospital only looks for fee and admission fee. Small child specialist clinics will take so much of care to the babies.Please choose other hospitals for new babies.After continuous follow-up this stupids will not respond at all. We need to beg them for the baby care and for feeding also. My daughter got weight loss because of this useless careless fellows.Only two sisters available for taking care of babies. Why we need to beg with them after paying them. 2 days after the birth my baby was not given any feeding at all and this useless fellows will make a round simply two times. My baby become weight loss and then after begging them they given feeding,1.0,Telangana 500072,a year ago

She is aggressive, rude and very proud and boasting about her 20 years experience. I would not recommend anyone to go to her. This is my first pregnancy and I don't think anyone should be treated the way this doctor have treated me. We should feel safe, instead of making me understand she was giving me directions and told me that I have to do as she instructs as she is the expert. I went for a second opinion and she was giving me all negative information & disrespecting my previous doctor consultation. Hope someone can teach her some etiquette and respect other doctors opinion. She asked me to do the same scan which I have done 6 days back when I asked her if it's required, as its very recent,  she said that my baby's heart beat might not be there and that's why I have to do the scan again. Who would want to hear that? That is the most uncomfortable thing I can ever hear. I am all fit and fine my blood and other test reports are excellent which I did 4 days back , I went to my previous doctor twice and confirmed everything was fine, but I still wanted a second opinion as this is my first pregnancy. She wants all the scan to be done in the Rainbow hospital and saying that other diagnosis centers are jack of all traits and nobody is an expert. She literally raised her voice while talking to me and I felt threatened. Please do not visit her at any cost. If there is any other way I can complain about her, I will be happy to do that.

I would have rated them 5 stars but the operations and billing department is slow and required too many followups. If the doctor discharges the patient after 4pm, you can only expect to get everything settled and completed after another 24 hours. They deliberately delay the billing so that they can take an additional days fee for the room. They will also not remove the canola drip until they have completed this process. It is the most frustrating part of the experience of visiting a hospital. I had to follow up continuously for getting the canola drip removed and to get the insurance processed.

Thanks to her patience and explanation in layman‚Äôs terms.- Scan reports are very detailed, these will help the doctor while making any kind of decisions.(Not sure about the outside lab reports)- Hospital has all kinds of facilities, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything During and after the pregnancy.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîCons:- Definitely expensive as compared to other hospitals, but the services are satisfactory.- Waiting time for Scans will be very high. (Be ready to spend nearly half a day)- [Important] For In-Patients, Hospital charges you ‚Çπ 10,000, by saying covid precautionary measures. If the entire hospital gets sanitised and everyone wears PPE kits also, it‚Äôll not cost half of the amount.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSuggestion to Patients:- Book a prior appointment before reaching the hospital, it‚Äôll save a lot of time for you in the hospital. Better choose the Early or Late slots. Do not chose intermediate slots, these slots will not go as planned.- If you‚Äôre a walk-in patient, expect a good amount of waiting time.- If possible get the blood tests done from Vijaya, Lucid or any other trusted Lab. This will save you from spending unnecessary charges.- Same goes with medicines too, Hospital pharmacy charges you the MRP. If you get them from Apollo, Medplus or 1mg, it‚Äôll save you nearly 30-40% of medicine costs.- I do not recommend the same for Scans, As above mentioned, it‚Äôs better to get the scans done from the Hospital itself. I saw a lot of patients from other hospitals , who are coming here just for the scan.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîFun Fact:- If you get twin sharing Room No. 209, It gives Private room Experience. üòú‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSuggestion to Hospital:- If the hospital provides a list of charges for Blood tests, scans and surgeries etc., It will be easy to estimate.",5.0,Telangana 500072,a year ago

The consultation fee is 800. Which was 600. And doctor told me to do nt scan from their side. The nt scan cost is 4000. I can't understand why they changes for its too much. The nt scan maximum charges is 1800 to 2000. I will never go again this hospital. Doctor say not to do scan from outside. I recommend to all to no go there. Go any other hospital. I called many big hospitals to know about the charges. They all are said that the charges should be in between 1800 to2000. Intolerable and unnecessary the charges a lot. Don't go there. You can get a same service for another hospital for less of cost. Medicover woman and children is a good hospital.. like this. And low cost. They just want to make money.For my 1st delivery of my baby one i  went o this hospital in lb nagar branch.. the cost of consultation fees was 600 and the doctor was also good. 2019 September i had a c section delivery.. for 72 hours they changes me about 90000/-.

I can confidently state that the doctors here are some of the best in the country and its infrastructures are immaculate.The doctors in its Hydernagar branch are excellent as well. They diagnose the disease accurately and can treat the most complicated ailments. My 12-year old son recently needed stitches (sutures) after he fell down and had a deep cut close to his left eye, with blood spilling all over. The doctor in Rainbow Hydernagar did that with precision without administering anesthesia. This is the beauty of the doctors in Rainbow Hydernagar. Its a complete kids and maternity hospital, boasting an excellent infrastructure.On the negative side, the prices are on the higher side, especially for the OPD and lab tests.

Talks to the point and treats you in a way that she is not interested in your case, often shouting unnecessarily at patients. 2 offsetting points I can remember is I) when my wife was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, instead of consoling and telling us way forward, she scared my wife by telling ugly consequences which ultimately scared her to the hell in her 7th month pregnancy. As a doctor she is expected to have some empathy towards first time parents and deal with us with some sense of assurance for security. I am not sure if that is too much I am asking for ii) we were blessed with a baby and we were all so happy and in the moment of happiness, she came and started shouting just because I had got my mom along with me and waited outside operation theatre, whilst I took permission from their authorities earlier, which I think was totally unprecedented.

"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Hospital & BirthRight, Hyder Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Sripriya Nayak,"We visited Rainbow, Hydernagar today for a consultation with Dr Vamireddy Kiran Kumar at 8pm, for our 7 month old son's vaccination.  Dr. Kiran was courteous and helpful . After the consultation, we proceeded for the vaccination. When we went to the OP pharmacy, it had shut down, so we were directed to the IP pharmacy, here the pharmacist took atleast half hour to get us the vaccine. By then the vaccination room had closed. So we were asked to go to emergency by a hospital staff.The ER was moderately crowded, even then we were made to wait for another half hour by the duty sister and doctor. All this waiting for one vaccination. Okay, we waited. During our wait, I went in with my baby to ask how much longer it would take. The doctor on duty, (either she was Dr. Navya or Dr. Saba), was extremely rude in her behaviour. When I was requesting the nurse to administer the vaccine, the duty doctor intervened and very rudely asked ""don't you know that this is emergency?"" and ""don't you understand what emergency means?"". To this I responded, of course I do, but since the vaccination room is closed and I was sent to the ER what do I do? Is it my fault that I was given an 8pm appointment? If vaccinations close at 8pm, then hospital shouldn't give such late appointments or atleast inquire if the patient is coming to be vaccinated or give an earlier appointment.Being a doctor who treats children, shouldn't this duty doctor have a little more sympathy and patience? As a doctor is your only duty to make a diagnosis and write a prescription? Surely, this duty doctor needs to develop a little more empathy and treat her patients in a little more humane manner. Rainbow needs to train such doctors to treat their patients with respect and kindness, and also communicate better with patients. A little bit of politeness and a smile can go a long way to create a more conducive environment for patients. Unfortunately polite communication is a skill that this duty doctor completely lacked in her professional behaviour.

"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Hospital & BirthRight, Hyder Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Venkatasriram Gutta,"I myself is a paediatrician / Neonatologist (IAP fellowship in Neonatology). Recently my wife who is an obstetrician gave birth to a girl baby at hydernagar rainbow. Obstetric services and nursing were very good. Especially thanks to Dr. Swapna (consultant obstetrician) who took care of my wife. I was very much happy with obstetric services.But the Neonatology services were not up to the mark that rainbow hospital advertises. We opted for Neonatology consultation but not the package. The consultant Neonatologist (Dr Rajasri) came to visit twice. The first thing she said was, ‚Äú I am absolutely unhappy that you have not chosen Neonatology services (which was our choice) and also said ‚ÄúDo you want me to see your baby or not, if not I have to discharge the baby right away‚Äù. Then my wife said we have chosen for consultation mam but not the package. Dr. Rajasri did not spoke with me first of all and she was very arrogant in her behaviour. She has lot of sarcasm in her talk and which was not expected by a professional. Apart from her no Pediatrician (in-house) visited in the evening times. Here vaccination was being done by nurses ( which should be done by pediatrician/ Neonatology trained doctors).  BCG was given subcutaneously, not intradermal. I thought then, I have given vaccination to hundreds of newborns but not able to give to my kid.This review is absolutely for the improvisation sake and not to hurt any doctor.

Not sure if they are trained or not. My baby's One thy was swollen and he was unable to move and can't even bare a small touch.

We were not at all urged to go for unnecessary medications or C-section. We were calmed down and assured by both of them that we can do it through natural way.Additionally, we were happy to have got Dr Pradeep Reddy sir as the assigned paediatrician for our baby. He provided us enough assurance and thorough guidance on each and every health aspect of the new born. He was cordial enough to accommodate all our questions with patience.I want to thank the entire hospital staff for making this a beautiful experienceWhole heartedly love and gratitude for Vijaya Sneha mam, Vasudha mam and Pradeep Reddy sir",5.0,Telangana 500008,4 months ago
"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight - Financial District, Hyderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Anurag Bhatnagar,"We have visited this hospital in emergency. My wife was in labour but since we are first time parent we were not sure if it is really a labour pain or some false pain.After visiting emergency : All the staff available in emergency are very co-operative and process oriented. After reaching an emergency, we were immediately attended by Ankita Paul mam and the first thing told by her to my wife is ""First of all don't worry and please smile."" We understood that we are in safe hands. Duty doctor available that time was doctor pragnya and she also is very knowledgeable and understanding. She immediately called our consultant doctor which is Dr. Pujitha Devi.For Pujitha Devi Mam:Delivery hai? Want normal delivery? Contact Pujitha mam without any delay.She is an expert, soft spoken and confident doctor. Dr.Pujitha has immense patience to answer all questions in a very friendly way. Even the dumbest questions from our side were answered by her in a very layman language with examples from day to day life.Coming to delivery : Our baby was in a breech presentation and we were told for the C- Section only. But on the day of labour when doctor checked, she said that we can try for normal. Initially we thought since we have made our mind for C-section and the pain that was borne by my wife was becoming unbearable why to change our mind now. But pujita mam convinced us and motivated my wife to try for normal for Max of 15-20 mins after which if she would be taking her for C-section (OT/nursing staff and others were kept on standby). Because of her motivation given to my wife, Baby was delivered by normal delivery. Many many thanks mam.I was standing outside the labour room and heard pujitha mam's voice stating ""Many many congrats, You are blessed with a baby girl. I am very happy for you guys.""NICU : Since my baby was born with some low weight, Doctor advised is to keep the baby in NICU atleast for one day to monitor well being of the baby. The Nursing staff available at NICU knows their duty and was helping my baby for feed and tracking vitals. They enlighten us about how to feed baby and other baby details. I was satisfied with the service that I have received from NICU staff and doctor Pradeep (Pediatrician- Senior Consultant).Room & Nursing Staff : We have taken the Single room and got all the required items for Baby as well as mother as a part of the room. Nursing staff is highly trained and helped us in all possible ways. They were ready to come even late nights for helping us in feeding baby. Totally happy with them.Food : Taste is the matter of choice and hence as per my taste, it was OK OK. I suggest to increase the quantity of Food if at all possible. I am not sure that quantity is fixed by any nutritionist or it is like that for all. That is just the small feedback from my side. Rest all is excellent in Rainbow ( specially staff in Emergency).

"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight - Financial District, Hyderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",LV prasad,"Very unhygienic hospital. no one cleans immediately when a child vomits on floor. I have seen this 3 times in my 9 visits to hospital.In my last visit I have not collected medicine as some one vomited at pharmacy and waited for 15 minutes no one cleaned it. Some visitors walked on it and carried all over the floor.Considering the present conditions I left hospital and visited again in evening to collect medicines.Very painful thing is we gave blood sample on 20th for pregnancy women but we are still waiting for report on 26th. Just think they collected around 3K and report not shared in one week. When I called they dont have the details of the test also.See how they are treating us. I have been calling them but they are simply holding and disconnecting.After continuous follow up they simply told your report prepared in 24 hours and its patients responsibility to get reports. At rainbow we will not call or send any reports for patients.when I questioned them why the reports are not uploaded in portal then they told, outsourced reports will not be uploaded in portal.Even manager Ramohan Reddy confirmed that all tests will not be done at Rainbow and few will be sent to Mumbai and Bengaluru, for which reports will not be up-loaded in portal. He also told you might have collected number from reception for reports.But Ours test is done at AMPATH Nallagandla, Lingampalli.Report was prepared and signed on 21-12-2023.After follow up and heated arguments I received the report at - 9:00 PM on 26-12-2023.No one told me while billing, sample collection or the customer care agents told me that the reports for outsourced service will  not be uploaded into portal.Even general store persons are calling for goods delivery. At Rainbow they have all our details and just dumped the reports in dustbin, no info was shared with us.Imagine the importance and consideration they are giving for visitors health. Even though doctors are good the management - capitalist will be interested only earing money.we are using Rainbow services from 2015 and now after 8 years of journey, I thought do we really need to use these where zero importance given to our health.But truly speaking, Doctor - Himabindhu Ma'am is very good, she gives detailed explanation for all reports, very friendly, she replys all mails.

Now after consulting another doctor, I came to know that it would come off and even if doesn't come as long as there is no bleeding, that's okay. My question is why would you not tell this information even after asking multiple times. Why would you always ask patients to go with something that is not even necessary???

Be it main branch Banjara hills or recently opened financial district branch. The management is pathetic, we went there early morning assuming there will not be any  process delays but at reception itself to register it took 40 min without any queue. This delay is because each one is asking for someone to do the registration.After all that gave my blood sample for reports they mentioned reports will be available on the website within 2 days. Today is the 7th day and the reports are still not available. When calling to get any information they just put me on hold. This is pathetic. The hospital with so much infrastructure as rainbow is not able to work properly then it's a serious issue at management level.I would not recommend this hospital to anyone.

I paid the bill which was 9650 Rupees. They told me to go to emergency room in 4th floor. After I go nurse was tieing me Gloves instead of Strap. I was so surprised and asked why are you not tieing the strap she told some one took and went. Then again she went and brought within a second which she could do earlier. The strap was so horrible and not at all tight she was telling me to catch it. And she injected the syringe where she was not able to drag the blood in the syringe, instead my blood was coming out but still she was poking in my veins as if Iam not a human being. It was so painful and I told to stop. And another person came and started experimenting my other hand. The way he was examining I felt I should not take any risk and walked out of emergency room and complained and asked receptionist to give back our amount¬† and he accepted for it. And another lady also saw what was happened and told the receptionist same. Pathetic and horrible experience which I never expected from Rainbow hospital staff. Who the hell will tie a gloves ? And keep poking even when the blood is oozing out. And Iam calling Rainbow hospitals for my return of money.They will tell we will arrange for call back which I did not get yet.

The paediatrician dr.arvind suggested for lab test CBP and CRP on 6th June 2023 and the samples were given on the same at 7pm...they submitted the report for cbp on 7th June by 9.30am and for CRP which was a crucial investigation for further I had to followup with them for report till 8th June till 10.43pm with multiple executives on call which they holded me for atleast 10mins each...and finally on 8th June I continously tried to reach them and contacted their manager and then they realised the sensitivity and posted the report ..which clearly shows the ignorance of earlier staff to send the report..it's better don't encourage such hospitals who are ignorant and least bothered until it gets escalate..but they shuld have understood they are dealing with child health...I suggest actors like mahesh babu to not to promote such hospitals and their service,1.0,Telangana 500008,10 months ago

Though got connected with the duty doctor after waiting for ages. Forget about any connection with your gynecologist..on third day I went with the same shivers n fever to emergency.. I asked for 2blankets as I was feeling extremely cold. They made me wait for 20 minutes saying oh I have told that sister to bring....that sister said i have told that sister to bring..(funny ..its an emergency ward) than brought only one saying we are allowed to give only one..they gave me two medicines for fever n as soon as the fever got down the sisters asked me to go home..I  told her that plz wait for sometime as my fever keeps on coming in every three hours. She said you go down at the reception and sit there..than that sister called the cleaning person saying clean the bed ..change the bedsheets another patient is coming..hey sister you think you are clever ..this time you have taken panga with the wrong person I must say. As rather then going down I waited outside the emergency room n noticed no other patient came..my chills have started again n my fever increased. I went down and complain at the reception.. My condition was deteriorating I waited n waited..now after all this drama the relationship manager came ..may be scared of my Google review which I warned them they will remember all there lives..she took me back to emergency which was locked from inside as I have no doubt that all the sisters were simply chilling as there was no patient..the manager asked for food n it came. Thanks for that..no sister turn up for next 20 minutes.I  asked the Cleaner for thermometer which I got after waiting for long..with high fever 101.6 I had to leave the ward as I had an appointment in op block..so this is my story about Rainbow..oh sorry...THE Rainbow the best hospital[the worst) in Hyderabad.,1.0,Telangana 500084,a month ago

When I asked to stay with him, I noticed blood already leaking and dropping to the floor‚Äîapproximately 20 to 30 drops. When questioned, they simply wiped the blood off and continued with the same procedure.I opted to admit my son to another hospital, not as well-known as Rainbow Hospitals, but the nurses there were exceptionally professional and delicate, especially with children.How can Rainbow Hospitals employ such unprofessional staff members given the high bills we are paying?

We had a pleasant experience during our two deliveries, one in 2019 and the other in October 2023.Choosing the right one: Trust and comfort is the first thing I wanted in choosing a doctor when we were expecting, it is when we came to know about Dr. Varalakshmi Nandyala at Rainbow Hospital, Kondapur. Though we shortlisted a few knowing from family & friends, I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Varalakshmi & others to help me decide which one to stick with during the course. My wife and I were clear and decided a lot in our first meeting with Dr. Varalakshmi Nandyala and our trust grew as we progressed. She is friendly, helpful, responsive, reliable to make the sweet journey comfortable.Learning the developments: Pregnancy is the sweetest period for any couple and their families. Our Dr. Gauri Vinayak helped us get to know the development of fetus with periodic scans. Thanks to her area of interest like Twin pregnancies, congenital cardiac defects, Congenital anomalies, intrauterine therapies, and genetic counselling.Choosing the Birthright: In our journey we got to know a lot about Birthright by Rainbow hospitals. They do really have a good team of expert Obstetricians, Neonatologists, and Gynecologists available 24/7 to attend.A Big Thanks: A big thanks to Dr. Tejaswi Nadella for doing what she does every single day. Doctors like her make the birth process one to be cherished and loved. She is amazing.Neonatal Care: A minor problem can worsen rapidly, but most issues are quick and simple to fix when diagnosed early. I have utmost respect and admiration for Dr. Kiranmayi. M who is professional, attentive, and kind. My experience was overwhelmingly positive and gave me confidence and comfort.Nursing is caring. I would like to convey my heartfelt gratitude to all the staff on the 4th floor who cared for my wife and babies so diligently during their shifts. I love to take this opportunity to thank Sandhya. B who explained about the importance of getting the Newborn screening done by which we get to know a lot more about the newborn metabolism or any disorders; and other nursing staff Pooja, Haleema, Anima, Nagamani, Chandmani and Sushma who made us comfortable and monitored our babies closely.Challenging time.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and Birthright by Rainbow, Kondapur (OP Block) Best Maternity Hospital",Rajkamal Kakollu,"Worst service. They do not have an emergency number, the ones provided don't work at all.  Complete misinformation. When you try Google etc and call up the reception, they just keep holding and pushing through some random people who do not even tell us their name or designation or department and talking with someone with us being on an active call and just holds and transfers without any information.  You'll be clueless what's happening. It's worth sharing, this process takes a good 20-30 minutes to reach and ask them a question, for which the answer is usually to visit the hospital.Everyone will ask you to visit the hospital for every query and make them wait for almost 2 hours at the hospital.In my case all I needed was to learn the following  :1. Gynec -  How to help the post pregnancy patient who has undergone through the C section deal with cough. Was asked to bring them to hospital the next day after discharge.2. Pediatrics - baby developed some pimples under arms and had discomfort to sleep and kept crying during the day, in fact they lost their voice crying.I've been to this hospital for almost 12-15 times during our term for almost an year, there was never a single instance when an appointment time was adhered to. If they say 1pm, it actually means only after 2.30pm. That's how it always had been.Most importantly, poor management and utilisation of staff, they're usually chit chatting and unavailable at the vital checking room, you'd find no one in that room, but when you check the other rooms around, you'll always find 4-6 people chit chatting there with no patients.  The staff at 3rd floor is clueless, someone wears a jacket and does some work which no one knows (this person usually doesn't respond no matter what you ask and how you try to make contact) and the others roam around. Just to get to billing they take 15-20 minutes, something they tell you it's just a follow up appointment and no need to pay after 20 minutes which was weird.Similar poor management on the 4th floor as well, one doesn't even respond or react or make an eye contact with the patient or customer when asked for anything. They take forever, cannot give you a time slot or adhere to it if provided. Also, we had to go through all gynecs (almost 4) as someone was always unavailable. So, don't bother about handpicking your doctor here, you or the staff would have no clue who your actual doctor is or was.I challenge anyone to try to prove me wrong. I'm sure a random walk-in  as a customer will prove my points with great confidence.",1.0,Telangana 500084,7 months ago

All amenities are located in the hospital only and are of very good quality.The only spoke in the entire proceedings are the billing and the hidden charges. While it is expected that the charges will be on the higher side, given the facilities and the reputation the hospital has, one should be well prepared in advance. There are a lot of hidden charges added which become apparent only once the final bill comes into the picture. One should also check the maternity coverage and the total coverage provided by the insurance to avoid last minute unpleasant surprises.Apart from that, I am very happy with the service, the quality and the facilities of the hospital provided.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and Birthright by Rainbow, Kondapur (OP Block) Best Maternity Hospital",Kumararaja Suseelan,"Our Experience With Rainbow Hospitals and Dr. Hima Bindu AnnamrajuSince Day 1 - Last Day(Whatever the number is), we always had a great moments with Dr. Hima Bindu Annamraju.Any day we meet her, she is so welcoming and with a smiley face, her first question will be 'How are you doing, how is your health'Dr. Hima Bindu Annamraju is so pleasant calm and handles with cool mind and doesn't make her patient to worry.Whenever we come out of her room, we will be carrying lots of positivity.And she is an amazing talent, she has so much experience loaded in her brain. Exact diagnosis and perfect treatment.There are doctors whom I have seen in the past to work for hospitals to make money - Do this test, that test and do it only in our facility. But she always said that, it's your choice.Whenever we walk in, she will start explaining various things in a continuous flow. After completing the details, she would ask 'Do you have any questions?' With her complete explanation, our questions in the mind will be answered automatically ( At times, we forget our questions too :) )Since the day of conception, she had a close monitoring on each day progress, evaluated thoroughly and took a best call for the baby delivery at the right time.When my wife was going to labour room, she had little fear but I wished her all the best and sent in. After 10 minutes, they called me to show the baby. And I met Dr. Hima Bindu Annamraju after 5 minutes, she wished me with a smiling face and explained how was the delivery and how my wife is doing and she also took care of post delivery steps very well.My wife was also had a great experience with Anesthesiologist as well ( I don't know the name though ). She took care of my wife like a baby, making her so comfortable by talking continuously with cute sweet words, as a result she doesn't even know that she is delivering a baby.Coming to the hospital experience,My wife and I had an excellent experience with Rainbow Hospitals, Kondapur and now with Financial District branch.Very smooth process on admission and discharge. They never bothered us in anyway. They took care of all the process, timely diet, continuous monitoring, etc.Very clean and neat rooms.Few things that can be improved -* Post Delivery, after shifting to the room, the care was little less. We had to call the nurses multiple times and at times they don't even turn up as they are too busy.* For each floor, there is only one cleaning helper, who takes care of all the rooms, changing the bed cover, etc. It is very hard for one person to take care of everything. Any adhoc help is asked, she would miss time for other rooms. Request to add 2-3 people to take care of the floor, then the patients will have more pleasant experience.* Nurses in each floor - They haven't explained things clearly, which resulted us in missing one of the important test. They are super busy too, as they are also limited in each floor. Request to add more, to have good support for patients.* Cost wise, it is an expensive hospital. Without insurance, it would be hard to manage the bill. But, the facilities and the quality justifies the price. It will be nice if the price can be reduced to give more confidence to the patients.My sincere thanks from my heart to Dr. Hima Bindu Annamraju for being a good human, good doctor. Your passion is amazing! Truly a role model!My since thanks to Rainbow Hospitals for providing us a great experience.I would strongly recommend both Dr. Hima Bindu Annamraju and also the Rainbow Hospitals, to have a pleasant experience.Thank you!",5.0,Telangana 500084,11 months ago

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and Birthright by Rainbow, Kondapur (OP Block) Best Maternity Hospital",Prakash Gourav,"We went to rainbow hospital Kondapur for a second opinion for a delivery - cesarean vs normal delivery on 2nd March 2023. We visited doctor Dr. Tejaswi Nadella.We were doubtful of the advice provided in another hospital to go for cesarean delivery. We were quite confused. The doctor said there was 50:50 chance of a normal delivery. However, while doing the physical examination the doctor did a cervical stretch and sweep suddenly. (A cervical stretch and sweep or membrane sweep is done to induce labor, we got to know a few weeks later.)She did not ask for consent from my wife. She did not even inform my wife that she was going to do so. My wife's scream could be heard on the entire floor. Momentary trauma aside this resulted in a prolonged labor for her for 3 days which was not progressing. She had to bear increasing labor pain for more than 72 hours because of this doctor. The doctor even casually remarked after the sweep that ""mai to sab patients ke sath aise hi karti hu"". You can not imagine the pain and trauma my wife (and family) had to undergo due to the carelessness of this person.I wish could do more than just leave a 1 star review against this doctor. :(Update: I sent the details to the email id as suggested on the reply on this review. They did not even acknowledge my email. No response.",1.0,Telangana 500084,a year ago

It reminded me of a government hospital where women sometime deliver in the verandah.The support staff are meant to show off their well pressed uniforms but lack even the basic empathy to smile or react to anything.Their appointment system is broken but the billing system still does a fantastic job, one has to spend the whole day for a minor checkup. The lab tests cost 3x of what they cost outside and yet the reports that they deliver are below standard. For ex: After charging 3000 inr for a urine test, the report we got was 'no foreign bodies found'People, For the gravity defying prices they charge, there are hospitals which can provide better services and have support staff trained to be more empathetic. Please do not contribute to their surging stocks prices or fall for their marketing.Update: They rubbed salt on wounds by calling us more than 7 times to know on where we were getting the baby delivered.Empathy=0, humanity=0.",1.0,Telangana 500084,10 months ago

A doctor measuring cervix length should never have sharp nails but this common sense was totally missing out of her, My wife had lot of pain due her sharp nails and despite my wife informing her about her sharp nails, she continued doing the process. I am surprised how hospital management is overlooking on these precautionary measures and allowing such doctors to perform such a sensitive test.We encountered another instance of her carelessness when she came to handover the discharge summary report. She seemed to in hurry and asked us to sign the report immediately, though as per discharge summary, one should sign only after going through the summary and usually it was supposed to be explained by her which she skipped. Due to this, we were almost about to miss our next appointment which was mentioned in the discharge summary as she didn't even explain a single word about discharge summary which is very concerning. Also She is very rude and needs to work on her attitude.Rainbow really needs to work on improving its doctors attitude, supportiveness and behavior. People pay hefty fees here to avail better treatment and to have better hospital experience, doctors here should be reminded by the management that they are not doing favor by treating the patient.

But that's not what we are here for, we wanted to meet doctor for checkup and get a viability test.Then her response is that you either wait 1 more hour to see doctor but scanning cannot be done because the technician isn't available or visit tomorrow.Why can't the same be informed at the billing that the doctor can't attend today?

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and Birthright by Rainbow, Kondapur (OP Block) Best Maternity Hospital",Sri Harsha Ramchandra,"We had an appointment with Dr.Lavanya Kannaiyan today at Rainbow and my feedback below:- My daughter had burns on her chest and she was taken to the ER and was treated well. They were superficial burns. Overall, felt they did a good job.- Next, she was referred to the doctor Dr.Lavanya Kannaiyan and we tried to meet her the following day. She diagnosed the baby and suggested few medicines. Overall, an OK experience as i felt she wasn't so receptive if you have questions. She asked to come back after a week. So, we thought fair enough and you can talk through things during next visit.- So, during the next visit it was indeed an bad experience. We felt that Dr.Lavanya lacked empathy to listen to patients concerns. I came to a hospital which is supposedly had a good name. But, the experience was rather like  an assembly line in a large factory. You hardly have few seconds/Minutes to talk through things with the doctor. I was concerned about the scars that the wound will leave on the baby and i was trying to get a sense of how they will be in the long term. As the burns were superficial, i was only trying to get her thoughts on the experience she has having dealt with other cases.   The doctor questions you back asking if you want her to predict future in a sarcastic way but doesn't tend to educate you. For a second, it made me think is this happening at Rainbow??? The anxiety of the parent here is only to find out what best we can do to address the issue if there is any possibility. The biggest surprise comes when you visit hospitals like these which has good names and you end up with this kind of treatment.- With this bad experience, felt that i need to take a second opinion and visit another doctor at the facility/outside even if i had to spend some extra bucks.- Please have empathy and also pls ask the hospital management to convey this to your doctors you hire.",2.0,Telangana 500084,2 years ago

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and Birthright by Rainbow, Kondapur (OP Block) Best Maternity Hospital",suresh,"I could have given zero rating. Emergency room will not have doctors available round the clock but they claim it to be 24/7. We had to wait for 15 mins in ER for a Junior doctor and all they do is check for vitals and inform Pediatrician over phone.Its a shame that a very widely known bacterial infection was not diagnosed by Dr David and was referred to the dermatologist consultation and visit him back in OP. The Hospital staff showed no help for dermatologist consultation and simply wiped their hands stating we do not have any dermatologist available. Pediatrician David showed least intrest in attending the case though he was available at the hospital which clearly shows their commitment to the service of Patients.we felt guilty for consulting such a pediatrician all these days.At the other hospital which we had to rush this case was diagnosed as a bacterial infection just by examination of the skin within no time and was advised for immediate IV antibiotics with PICU admission while at Rainbow Kondapur they were so casual to state to consult dermatologist and come back for OP consultation.We we're also informed that the diagnosis of this bacterial infection does not necessarily need a dermatologist consultation and it would also be done by Pediatricians.Rainbow Kondapur team- Please do not play with the life of patients who come on an emergency. You people need to have your ER room with a Senior Qualified and capable Pediatrician available round the clock or do not claim it to be 24/7 emergency.Please recheck your Pediatrician experience ,qualification and capabilities and do not make the Kids suffer because of doctor incapabilities in diagnosis and lack of commitment to serve the Patients.I would definitely not recommend Rainbow Kondapur for any emergency and Dr David as a Pediatrician.Greviance team was informed on this and all they could do is to provide a OP coordinator contact number to avoid any hustles for our next OP visit stating that the management will look into it. What will they look into it further? It's clear that you do not have doctor availability round the clock. Lack of commitment of the Pediatrician to attend the case as he was about to leave hospital after night shift and your hospital staff negligence to help us further as a reason why we had to rush to other hospital.Do you think I would still trust your team and the Pediatrician for future consultations? No one would take a second chance with their kids health with this horrible experience.I learnt that Rainbow Kondapur is meant for kids only for Regular growth check up, vaccinations and for common cold and cough.I feel sorry for my Kids for choosing Rainbow Kondapur and Dr David for Pediatric services all these years.",1.0,Telangana 500084,a year ago

She is super fast taking the readings she miss that we are keen to know the details as well.This was supposed to be a better branch, however as it age you will observe IP branch rooms are worst and post delivery you wish you would get discharged because of those bathrooms ( we stayed in private). changed in two  of them and both were stinky.Doctors are experienced but most of times their intensions is to get the patient out of the room.

After 10min staff is calling everyone(the one who came after us) except us, after waiting for 1 more hour again i left to wonder when my turn would finally come and asked receptionist about the same, she said ""your name is not listed here"". I was shocked and told her about my appointment at 4.10pm, now they are saying we need to register again by paying registration fee at other cabin. After waiting for 2 and half hours, they are informing us to register for consultation.Receptionist here appeared disinterested and there was a noticeable lack of clear instructions regarding the process and absence of communication about basic information was deeply concerning.If we wouldn't ask them they will make us await whole day and wont give any info regarding registration or anything else.There is no proper communication from hospital to patient for appointment.I understand that hospitals can face unforeseen circumstances and emergencies, which can impact waiting times.

(Except for doctor appointment, scan and sample collection, nothing happened)Poor management of staff.No ownership by anyone, incorrect information provided over phone about appointment, they declined honouring the same when visited in person.Reception staff did not forward the file to the doctor on time, doctor walks by reception after 30-45minutes to find the receptionist who isn't available there, but takes the files herself and calls patients herself, later asks receptionist to be there and do the job and literally hits her with the files that were supposed to be forwarded.Had to request thrice for inputs on bundle package, they said, they'll explain the same. Had to follow up twice or thrice.Scan staff says it's outside my shift hours and keeps suggesting to wait for the next person, but keeps roaming around without taking care of patients, sample collection room blames scan room staff is at fault stating they failed it to do it the right way during the first scan ( which happened 2hours ago). The only thing the staff was good at was gatherings and chit chatting about random things around sample collection room and reception area. Customers aren't the priority at all.The reception staff says there's no one I can talk to and complain about, rather just give me a feedback form, which I've filled tooSpent close to 5+ hours, out of which more than 75%+ is waiting period.Please note, the staff here is not experienced, they have no clue what they're doing.  They do not even guide where to go for NT scan or for sample collection. Most importantly they do not co-ordinate and work together. Says something is missing in scan and keeps getting the same scan done again and again.Had more than 4 disappointments in the first visit. Nothing more can go wrong.

It's because of the OP lab. They some times don't give correct results.  And manipulate the new to be parents for money and I am telling this from experiance. They told for my 4th month scan that my baby nasal bone is 2.5 which is a indicator for neurological issue. And they made me do the NIPT test which costs 15k. I had the same scan done after  5 days in vijaya kukatpally because my family insisted , the nasal bone was 4.1. So the rainbow lab lady cheated other wise is it really possible for nasal bone to grow so much in 5 days. The mental stress I went through those two days was horrible.

"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Clinic, Birthright Women‚Äôs Clinic & Fertility Centre (Op Block)",Madhu Yalamarthi,"Dr. Radhika Yadati was very helpful. She went above and beyond to help my sister with her pregnancy complications.Earlier in the pregnancy, my sister had complications, we weren't sure about the pregnancy and even started to worry about my sister's health. When the situation got serious - in the middle of the night and at the peak of the second Covid wave, we went to her based on a friend's recommendation.She attended immediately in the middle of the night and stabilized the situation. Moreover, she eased my sister out of the complication and with continuous guidance and care, she helped my sister have a full-term pregnancy. She did no invasive surgeries nor crazy medicines. When we asked for second opinion from doctors in the US at Stanford Medical Hospital, they also agreed with her plan and supported it.My sister delivered a healthy baby, and both the mother and baby are very healthy. Thanks to her patience and knowledge, it was possible. Moreover, Dr. Radhika is unique in her way for being so humble and approachable. She spoke in Telugu with my parents and helped them understand the situation and manage expectations. She spoke in a fun and funny way to my sister and brother in law and gave them confidence and tips. For someone of her seniority, she didn't have to do that. But her doing so, made the whole experience over months less stressful.We are thankful for Dr. Radhika Yadati and the Rainbow team, and we highly recommend them for others.",5.0,Telangana 500081,2 years ago

May be there are some able and good doctors but what we got was a lemon. Wanted to give 1 star but you know the human factor pitched in and gave 2 stars instead.Bangalore Rainbow: we consulted at least 5 different pediatricians and all of them were like gems and they knew exactly what they were doing and what they were suggesting.

Your call will be diverted to atleast 3 people for appointment and they will finally say that they will callback, but that never happens.You have to definitely call them again.The only reason to visit is because of Doctors, the consultantion is good.

"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Clinic, Birthright Women‚Äôs Clinic & Fertility Centre (Op Block)",shreyashi satpathi,"The reviews are all fake ...I request to all not to see the reviews ...Dnt ever go to Rainbow clinic Hyderabad  for the infertility treatment .The IVF doctor Preethi Reddy  knows nothing ...she follows the same treatment for everyone , gives the same dosage of medicine to every patient ,she only knows how to take money from the patient and she will go through first IUI then IVF even if there is no need of going through IUI process who has lower AMH level and after the egg extraction process they will tell you lie that only 1 egg got retrieved even though there were no eggs found ,for the sake of money .I spent my money to get the good treatment so that I can get the a result . I know result is not on our hand but what is in our hand is treatment.If you asked them for the evidence that why the fertilization didn't happen they wont show anything in written everything is verbal. when I visited other clinic they showed me everything in written and pictures also is there for  eggs status .The reviews are all paid .For the whole process you have to wait for 2 to 3 hours everyday for 1 injection . The doctor Preethi Reddy will go through the same in future so that she will stop cheating people like us.when I consult other doctor got to know that a local anesthesia (injection on vain) is more then sufficient for egg extraction process ....but rainbow gives you spinal cord injection for egg extraction process ..and in IVF, most of the time we may  need  to go through 2 to 3 times or more than that...so think how many times you will go through this spinal cord injection process .....I have visited Rainbow clinic almost 6 months and gone through the wrong process ...so keep this thing in mind before choosing rainbow ....I beg everyone not to go to Rainbow clinic for infertility treatment .

Only excuse from the nurse/sister was that there were 2 beds, so doctors will be responding leisurely. Post doctor checkup, they give crocin or other generic medicines, which in turn makes baby no change in recovering and this forces us to make another follow-up strictly.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight, LB Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Vidyasarma G,"Writing this review upon my self paediatric experience. General paediatric treatment is very good. But there is no sync with the Neurologist and Psychologist assessments and treatment.After analysis, the neurologist Dr.Geeta Chanda said that my kid is neither with ADHD nor ASD conditions, but a genetical behavioural change with hyperness and suggested a month medicine to control that hyperness and suggested for IQ test for another doctor. It was good at first but within a week, that hyperness triggered back and by the end of medicine course she became too much of hyper kid. We are unable to control her at all.When we consulted Dr.NagaNandini for IQ test, her analysis was different and she directly mentioned my kid as Autistic and needs to do further assessment which costs 5400. Also, I was suggested to give therapy treatmens and not use any medication like the one suggested by neurologist. I didn't understand why does it cost that much for assessments. Being a single mother, I couldn't bear that much amount just for assessments and did not go back there.I already had her assessed at one of the reputed medical research centers at Chennai and was being told that my kid is with ADHD. They did all the checkups related to eye, ear, speech and audio including a report and treatment suggestion just at the cost of 900. Blood test took me extra cost. It was 1.5 years ago. We do understand that treatment at Rainbow is expensive because the treatment is very good at its standards. But confusing and sort of threating parents with such treatment indifferences is not at all fair as I do have clear understanding of ADHD and autistic traits of kids upto certain age. But stamping a kid directly is atrocious.I am imploring the Rainbow management team to look upon this and try to stop threatening parents with a different approach if treatment and cure of special kids is not the main motto instead of business.",2.0,Telangana 500074,a month ago

We filed a complaint on all these issues to mod, what action they have taken till now no update)3. Dr. Satyanarayan - about him I really dono what to say,(weather he is good at his job or not)he just don‚Äôt listen to parents and start giving examples of homeless people and their children and only suggest with random tests, baby got urine infection we asked for the cause of it he suggested for a random test which is not at all requires.lots and lots of attitude whole rainbow team, they think that they are treating us for free where as charging us for each and everything.Such a waste",1.0,Telangana 500074,a month ago

If we have to follow up for everything like we do at the government or a local C - grade hospital . They why we should come here and wait for hours for the reports. Also, for every scan they ask for the hard copies of the aadhar card. Even in the local hotels they will take the aadhar card and scan it for their records.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight, LB Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",ramesh babu,"A Mixed ExperienceI have been a regular visitor to this Hopital for the past four years, primarily under the care of Dr. Satyanarayana Kavali. While the medical treatment received here has consistently been top-notch, my recent experience left me with mixed feelings due to certain administrative issues.On the positive side, the medical treatment provided by the hospital is undeniably good. Dr. Satyanarayana Kavali and the medical staff have always shown dedication and expertise in their fields, ensuring the well-being of their patients. However, my experience was marred by a few concerning issues.One of the most noticeable problems was encountered during the counseling process. The staff member assigned to assist me seemed to have a rather uncooperative attitude, particularly when it came to assigning a private room based on my insurance coverage. This left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied.Another financial concern arose when I was charged INR 5,000 for non-surgical expenses, but my insurance claim was only reimbursed with INR 3,500. This pricing discrepancy should be addressed and resolved promptly.Furthermore, the insurance department's response time was disappointingly slow. While I expected a 30-minute turnaround for insurance claims, I had to wait for nearly two hours before any action was taken. This delay was inconvenient and added unnecessary stress to an already challenging situation.In summary, my experience at Rainbow has been a mix of excellent medical care but less than satisfactory administrative and customer service aspects. I believe that with some improvements in communication, insurance processing, and staff attitudes, the hospital can maintain its high medical standards while ensuring a more seamless and positive experience for patients and their families.I hope these concerns are taken into consideration by the hospital management to improve the overall patient experience.",3.0,Telangana 500074,5 months ago

"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight, LB Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Ravi Shekhar,"Rainbow Children‚Äôs Hospital and Birthright LB Nagar is One of the worst hospitals in Hyderabad East. I had to visit the hospital with my 2 month old infant and was shocked to see the plight of their emergency room. Children/ Kids/ infants were treated like cattle. Their total disregard for the basic protocols was deplorable. At the billing counter they were still handing out hand written receipts. The DR‚Äôs had prescribed some tests which were basic tests but the charges were Premium. Since I had heard a lot about the brand Rainbow I had decided to go ahead with the tests even though they were charging a hell lot more than what other reputed diagnostic centres charge. But we still decided to go ahead with Rainbow since they specialised dealing with Infants but believe me they were not at all proficient. Moving on, we had given the samples at around midnight and were assured that the reports would be sent to my mail by 11:00 AM positively. At 12:00 noon I still didn‚Äôt receive the reports after which I started calling them. I called they call center and asked them to connect me to the LB Nagar branch to which I received the response that they have issues connecting to the Lab(The Hospital call centre itself is unable to do that!!!!!). After about an hour of trying I finally was able to connect to the lab and requested them to mail me the reports to which they said that sending reports by mail would not be possible and guess what, the lab person was reading out the values from the report asking me to make note of them. I guess , a government hospital would have done a better job at handling my case. I urge people to consider twice/thrice before visiting the LB nagar branch of this hospital.",1.0,Telangana 500074,6 months ago

"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight, LB Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Nanda Kishore,"After writing review, We get response from rainbow team saying they may contact us but that never happens even after sharing contact details.Update: 24/Aug/23My wife had excessive vomitings and had to admit in hospital.Firstly, we went for normal checkup as she's having excessive vomitings. I had dropped my wife at the entrance and went for parking car. The parking lot was full and I had to wait to park it somewhere else. Meanwhile i got a call from my wife saying she's feeling dizzy and getting cramps and stomach pain.I had to Rush and luckily some person who came for her check up was supporting my wife.No one from hospital was there to take care such cases. I had to run to reception asking for emergency and they react very normally and just showed the way to emergency room. Later when requested for aaya help, the receptionist was shouting for aaya's help but after a while she comes. Now, when we went to Dr. Saroja madam's place and I had informed receptionist that's it's emergency as my wife was saying she's going to fall down as she's feeling dizzy. Inspite of mentioning that's it's emergency the receptionist had put our file after another patient and told us to go after that patient! How foolish is it..Dr. Saroja took immediate care.The security people were worst, they address you rudely. They don't know how to talk professionally.The canteen food is not as expected, they give low quality rice which is really pathetic for new moms.Looks like more beds and nurses are needed as I see patients who come for delivery are made to wait.Though nurses are helpful, I feel sometimes they don't their job as needed.Overall I feel that the staff only care about money. They give the least importance and respect to the patients and their family. They feel like they're doing free service and we're waiting eagerly to get the services. Thankfully doctors are not like that which is the main reason I'm still preferring the hospital.Staff should behave professionally!---------------------------------------We have recently shifted temporarily to hyderabad(my native) from bangalore as we need family support during my wife's pregnancy and we were in search of good gynecologist and hospital.After a lot of search, we have finalised and visited Dr. Saroja. She was very patient and gave enough time to discuss things with us, no hurry! 5 stars rating to Dr. Saroja.She even suggested not to use extra folic acid as that's not usefu as we used to take mcbm69 and recently started taking Livogen-z which already has folic acid in it..and she also told to stop taking vit-d for prolonged period.Some negatives:-Note that as we used to visit cloudnine hospital in Bengaluru and I'm comparing it with that as well. Cloudnine was awesome be it doctor or scans or lab tests or facilities, etc. Compared to that here I seeThe maintenance is not great for such a professional hospital.There's lot of crowd which is not the hospital's issue but the seating facilities can be improved I feel.The snacks counter is just next to the seats and is quite congested. Being a kids hospital there's junk food which is not good for kids!Car Parking space is ample, but from there to hospital the path is not good! There's not enough space at main entrance of the hospital and say if two cars come saying emergency delivery then that's not easy. At cloud nine in bengaluru there's valet service. I'm not expecting valet everywhere but at least the pregnant ladies should be able to get inside the hospital along with attendants without any issues in case of emergency.The washrooms were not great.The nurses were not as professional as what we expected.The receptionist with whom we interacted took lot of time for registration but still wrote incomplete/wrong address. Even for the medical certificate the content was written with mistakes.The rainbow app is not a useful one.There was only one person in the financial counseling room. while we're discussing about packages, two more people came for admission and they had to wait for quite sometime.",1.0,Telangana 500074,7 months ago

We rushed and get the tests done, we requested her to view our reports but she refused to see the reports and she left mentioning that she only works till 4. We asked her to give some medicine for fever she asked to get the consultation from general physician. I never encountered such a reckless and irresponsible doctor. We don't know if it is okay to take normal medication to treat the fever during pregnancy. How can a doctor be so irresponsible.Although I stay just 5 mins from Hospital, I choose not to continue here and opted to get my wife checked out at Fernandez.Not just that, no one in the hospital treats you well, there is no smile on anyones face, you could feed the irritated faces.",1.0,Telangana 500074,9 months ago

The hospitals appointment is just for the sake of it and they let people in with their wish.This is a feedback hospital should be responsible and looking into to improve the standards. In this new norm we already are struggling with extention hours at workplace and bad traffic on which we do not wish to wait so we book appointment.Overall a very bad experience!! This is the 6th or 7th time I'm visiting and it never happened on time. We have to wait or tell one of the receptionist to check our appointment time. Waiting for 10/15mins is common but 90mins of waiting post appointment is a concern.Requesting the specific team to kindly work on the above mentioned.Thank you for understanding.,2.0,Telangana 500074,a year ago

After that, you wont even get 5 mins to talk to her.2. While one patient is in, second patient will be called in and she consults 2-3 patients at once. No attendants are allowed. She wont listen to your questions or concerns, she just recites her solutions/medicines and junior doctors writes them down3. You have to speak with jr doctors outside her cabin and ask them doubts. You pay 650/- to talk to junior doctor?4. We visited with perinial abscess in initial stage with lot of burning and pain. We were sent to duty doctors as I couldnt hold pain and sit. Those duty doctors made me wait for 1-2 hours before one comes and observe my condition. One of duty doctor made fun of my condition when a nurse asked her to do checkup on me.they were just intrested to talk stuff and go for cake cuttings and all leaving patient behind for hours. I went in at 10:30 and came out at 2pm and no treatment is given.5. They took just urine test and said nothing in it go home. When went back to koteswari, she didnt evendo checkup on abscess blindly wrote medicines and sent home.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital & BirthRight, LB Nagar, Hyderabad - Best Maternity Hospital",Vamshikrishna Sandela,"Very Disappointed. Understood the true flip sense of ""Don't Judge a book by its cover"". Got a feeling of govt hospital. I admitted my wife in this hospital for a scheduled delivery. Gynyc docs are very good and responsive. Delivery happened on time. Attendants have to wait for 7 hours sitting on the chairs. For a csection they usually refer a 3 day stay at the hospital. Problems started from here. Problem1: Staff reported different time of birth in 2 reports. It is disappointing as being unsure on baby's time of birth though they tried to convince me on 1 TOB. Problem 2: Another blunder is, they updated baby's gender as male. Again I have to coordinate with multiple people to get it corrected. Problem 3: For a 1st time mother it's bit tough here as they allocate a feeding nurse only for a couple of times and then they leave the responsibility to a female attendant to help the mother in feeding the baby. I have to followup many time with the support staff in calling for help from the feeding nurse. Problem 4: I have asked for a private room package but alloted a sharing room. When asked for a single room after a day of joining, they just keep on beating around the bush and not confirming any. Very poor management and wrong expectations set to patients (got know later that this happened with many people). I kept following up at frequent intervals but did not get single room for 2 of 3 days where only 1 attendant has a facility to stay with the patient at night either the husband or a female relative. One of them will not find a place to sleep at night. I tried sleeping on chairs, then tried sleeping in my car. Still its our second day at hospital, have to see what challenges I need to face regarding, final billing, insurance coverage, getting back the security deposit, final settlement etc...",2.0,Telangana 500074,2 years ago

After a while, fearing my baby's safety and my pain tolerance, I requested them to stop inducing pains and go for a c section. My requests were unheard. Duty doctors Dr. Priyanka and Dr. Sahitya were extremely rude with me and my attendants, especially Dr. Sahitya. I don't understand why such a reputable hospital like rainbow employs duty doctors like Dr. Sahitya who doesnot understand that patients are human beings but treats them like machines. She almost killed my baby. It is my luck and Dr. Koteswari Ganta's expertise that I could successfully deliver a baby girl through a c section after going through alot both physically and emotionally. The duty doctors dont correctly convey patient's issues to the consultant doctors, neither they allow patient or attendants to directly speak to the consultant doctors. I would suggest people to think twice before getting admitted at Rainbow lbnagar for delivery related issues. However the pediatric care is fine as per my experience till now.

They create an situation where you will be compelled to go for C-section. You can ask their history record for difference in % of normal delivery.3. I have been counselled by multiple hospital management people for approval to do multiple test on a baby of 3day period just to increase my bill. It was clearly evident from their attitude when I asked more details about tests necessity.4. Multiple sugar test (15no.) for 3day old baby were written on bills but in actual I allowed them to conduct only 5 no.s that to forcefully to achieve their financial targets. In-addition they will not take your signature on official paper where its clearly written that patient concern is mandatory for every test.5. Finally even after paying huge sum of money the stitches given by a doctor or junior doctor in OT were worst than my ""TAILOR""6.

Rainbow has a brand of treating like a mother but here in LB Nagar they are treating customer like slaves. No response from the staff.  Worst and unhygenic rooms. Nurses asking money. Security is talking very rash when we request to see the new born. No washrooms except for one floor. They use lifts only for staff form Basement and when we request for my grand mother who is age of 58 they are saying due to covid only staff can use lift from basement and all other should use the same lift from First floor what kind of logic is this?No proper info or response from doctors. With the name of covid they are not even allowing to visit family members to see the new born but they allow anyone in visiting hours. So what's your idea behind this? Do you think one time contact during visiting hours doesn't affect the kid?I never ever recommend this hospital to anyone. We had treatment in Yashoda and this rainbow is not even 1% of that range.

He was kept in ICU for 1 day and then moved him to ward the next day. They gave him antibiotics 3 times a day and drops for cold. It went well for 4 days, then they discharged.  They asked us to start oral antibiotics. We strictly followed the medication prescribed to him. He recovered very well. Upon our follow up visit (which is 4 days after the discharge), the doctor asked us to stop all medicines as the baby looked fine.The actual problem started then. Cold along with severe cough the next day. We have taken him to hospital immediately. They observed him, told us it's viral infection and admitted him again.  The whole admission process along with blood tests repeated. The same doctor (Dr. Reena) started treating him the same way they did before. After 4 days, doctor told that he can be discharged and started all discharge formalities.  My son was coughing like anything. This time we haven't seen any improvement in his health. He cried his lungs out, but none responded. There were nurses who were busy doing their paper works. None bothered even to ask what happened to the baby.

Went for 2D Echo scan. Waiting lounge was small with mostly occupied by parents. More than one attended was allowed in the waiting area just outside the Echo room. After entering the Echo 1 room for scanning situation was worse. A small room with too many people inside. Nurses are laughing, doing fun and chit chats in mobile. May be they didn't even realise that there can be worried parents for their kids. Now before every scan neither they are sanitising the equipment which they are using for scanning to move around the body nor using the paper bed roll considering these are small kids and can be infected quite easily. Travelled more than 20 km just for a scan with high expectations as the brand name is 'Rainbow' but came back with lot of dissatisfaction and disappointment after experiencing poor crowd management and unhygienic scanning experience. Hopefully, management will take this feedback positively and start looking into the things immediately to improve the situationand make the environment healthy for kids to provide a better experience just like other Rainbow branches.

As the heart of my baby could not be adequately visualized in the scan carried out by the fetal medicine expert, she referred me to Rainbow Children's Heart Institute, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad to undergo Fetal Echo.I couldn't get the slot on the date recommended by the fetal medicine expert, so I informed to Ms Preethi, Guest Relations Executive of this institute. She was kind enough to understand the urgency of the scan dates and accommodated my request and scheduled my Fetal Echo as a special case. Ms Preethi welcomed us and maneuvered us to the fetal echo section.I was flabbergasted to see the hospitality of the receptionist and staff in guiding us wherever required. I didn't feel like I was in a hospital as the ambiance is spick and span. There was no distinctive¬†antiseptic & chloroform¬†kind of odour generally associated with many hospitals. There are plenty lounges for the visitors to relax with TVs. All the facilities like centralized AC, hiegenic water supply, cafeteria, waiting halls, washrooms etc. are well maintained. We had sumptuous lunch in the cafeteria at cellar.As my baby was in a challenging position all the time, 3 very experienced Pediatric Cardiologists - Dr Shweta Bakhru, Dr Bhargavi Dhulipudi and Dr Pooja Sinha tried hard and could visualize most parts of the baby. By evening, with the kind intervention of Dr K. Nageswara Rao, Pediatric cardiologist with experience of more than 30 years, they could complete the fetal echo successfully. As the result is normal, all of us got great relief.

We spend our time and money because you‚Äôs is reputed hospital where my baby will be treated well. So please stop running after the money at least on kids.2. Please work on the appointment schedule timing because you are dealing with babies under 2years, for parents it will be difficult task to control them.3. Please switch on the feeding room AC which is located underground without any ventilation. How do you think mother and babies will have safe feeding in that room or you can charge extra money at the time of appointment booking for feeding room AC.4.

Unluckily, one scan seems to have been possible only in Banjara Hills branch. We took prior appointment before coming here. My wife is a registered patient in the Rainbow hospital. Still, they made us wait in the chair (against what doctor advised) for couple of hours just for registration which I don't understand the purpose as it is the same chain of hospitals and after appointment is taken. They are understaffed which causes loss of patience for the staff, overcrowded, lack of maintanance, the chairs are dirty.Overall... The doctors are good and caring but the administration has failed utterly. When you can't manage, you should give relaxation and tell your doctors to accept the scan reports taken outside the hospital chain.

"Rainbow Childrens Hospital & BirthRight - Himayat Nagar, Hyderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Anish K,"Service in the Hospital and response of Doctors, Duty Doctors, Billing people and Coordinators was just OK but not great. We felt only the Duty nurses are working hard, dedicated towards their duties and they really doing their job with passion. Even Cleaning staff and security staff are doing great. That's the reason i gave 2 stars for them. Price for the lab tests are very high when you compare with Vijaya diagnostics etc., and when you ask about the prices Coordinators will tell you to get it done outside and without bill they don't do anything. They say they deal high risk pregnancies and they have experts but in our case there is an expert gynic doctor named SS, she hates to deal high risk cases and used say that ""veellu tedaga unnaru"", ""naa grahachaaram baaga ledu anni ilanti cases vastunnai"" and in return her puppets says ""meeru homam cheyandi maam"". How do you feel when you hear such statements? Can we say ""mee hastavaachi baaga ledu, mee daggariki raakunda undaalsindi"", We really felt bad by your service and the way treated us, pain still not going away. You are ready to spend lakhs of money for better treatment, care and response but definitely you will be disapponted and you can see the true colors post delivery the way all these People behaves. For the discharge also one by one person keep on come to your room and ask when you are going to discharge though you have more than a half day left to vacate. If there is any mistake from Coordinators or Duty Doctors side they simply blame on us and says we informed already but patient didn't follow. There are many things like this  ..**Please don't believe online reviews.

"Rainbow Childrens Hospital & BirthRight - Himayat Nagar, Hyderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Harsh Agarwal,"Worst experience we have had with a children‚Äôs hospital ever. My daughter was asked to get a blood test by the doctor at the hospital for a possible infection. The team at the emergency room responsible were absolutely unprofessional and unkind to a 3 year old . Despite poking needles 3 times and twisting the needle IN HER ARM trying to find the vein to draw blood while my daughter was screaming in pain they have the absolute no sympathy and common sense. They asked my wife to leave the emergency room to leave her alone for drawing blood with the staff and blamed it on her writhing in pain. How do you leave a 3 year old child alone without a parent or a caretaker to get blood tests ? Is this normal? Despite the fact that through the process of being poked multiple times my daughter was brave enough to stay calm during inserting needles and only starting screaming when they twisted the needle in her arm , Mr Shiva Baditeyla wanted my daughter to be left alone and blamed it on her screaming in pain for the lack of drawing blood . If you are a parent , you can understand the pain of watching your child in this condition. Never going back to this hospital and I hope this hospital has the sense to taking an action against this man and training its staff to handle children with medical expertise, patience and kindness.

"Rainbow Childrens Hospital & BirthRight - Himayat Nagar, Hyderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",A Omkareshvar,"My younger son was admitted on March 21st at the Himayathnagar branch of Rainbow Hospital. From admission to discharge, Rainbow Hospital (Himayathnagar branch) provided the best treatment. Personally, I feel that the doctors at this branch take good care. In my opinion and experience, the pros of this hospital include a good hospital ambiance, neat room maintenance, excellent and caring doctors, and ample parking space. However, the hospital considers 12 noon to the next 12 noon as 24 hours, rather than considering admission time. There should be better coordination between admission staff and billing staff. Additionally, I would like to mention that the hospital charges and fees are high compared to other clinics or hospitals, but the quality also matches the cost/price paid. They will not insist but explain the whole process, and the final decision will be with the parents.The room provides a TV, but most of the channels are for adults; the TV has apps but no WiFi, and the built-in apps for kids are not functional due to the lack of WiFi (I am not sure now, but from admission to discharge, there was no WiFi). As the TV helps divert kids' attention from pain to some extent, I feel that's worth mentioning. I thank Dr. Sanjay sir Dr. P.

"Rainbow Childrens Hospital & BirthRight - Himayat Nagar, Hyderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Nishitha A,"When discussing hospitals with corporate entities, it's important to consider not just the doctors but also the backend team, administration, and so forth. In my experience, hospitals should be more organized, akin to hotel check-ins where they count 24 hours from 12 noon to the following day at 12 noon. Under this system, stays may extend beyond one night, resulting in extra charges. My final verdict is that hospitals ( especially Rainbow himyath nagar branch)should be more patient-friendly and cost-effective. They should consider counting 24 hours from the time of admission rather than using the 12 noon to 12 noon approach. Additionally, many doctors at this branch are visiting consultants. During my child's plastic surgery and subsequent follow-up, a resident student from Rainbow Hospital provided care. While this offers practical experience, it's disappointing that it doesn't always guarantee gentle admission, coordination, billing, and follow-up sessions. Although Rainbow's pead student seats aren't free, I believe they come with a significant fee. I express my disappointment not with the doctors, but with the overall experience. I may opt to visit a nearby clinic for follow-ups where senior pediatricians are available instead of dealing with students. Ultimately, when it comes to health, parents cannot take any chances.",2.0,Telangana 500029,a month ago

As this is new so people were still trying to get things sorted here but overall I felt, Reception service was good, quick, communication of reception help desk was also good, the positive points are nursing staff, help desk staff, cleanliness, spacious place, seating area, easy to locate place. The only point which I suggest to improvise is baby weighing machine as we need to put the baby down the board area was not that long/big(as some babies are tall), comparatively the one baby weight machine in Banjara hills branch is big.If my experience were to describe in few points:Good Patient ExperienceExperienced DoctorAccessibilityCleanlinessKnowledgeable Help deskSpaciousGood Parking SpaceEasy to locateMade the experience as seamless as possible",4.0,Telangana 500029,4 months ago

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Vamsi Krishna,"I have been consulting a doctor Shiva Narayana Reddy in this hosp. for my kid from past couple of years. Here is my review.Positives:1. The doctor is very professional.Normally he wont give antiboitics easily and also they wont prefer to go for unnecessary testings. He listen patiently to all your queries. Most of the time,my baby recovered well after following the medication that he give.2. The staff wony be impatient to any one. Even though they are busy,they listen to you and guide you.3.Need to appreciate the frontline health workers here.4. The new building is having good space when compared to old one. The waiting place is better than the previous.Negatives:1. This vikrampuri branch is shifted to a new location. But i was not informed though i toom appointment by phone twice. It would have been much better if i was informed earlier as i missed the morning time appointment...2. Once the payment is done, they would give some token number but it wont work and there is no token system here... They will send one by one. Every time I visit, there would be atleast one instance of fighting between parents ans staff. Parent would be complaining that they came first and why they are sending the other..3. The blood tests are getting collected in the emergency ward. There was a huge line of parents and children waiting for their turn in the emergency ward. Seriously? I know how much disturbance  the parents in the emergency ward are facing due to this. It would be much better if they can collect the samples somewhere else.4. The waiting room for covid vaccine persons and patients are same. Woukd be much better if they have a different location as it wont be safe for children sitting along with them.5. They took blood samples of my kid . They mentioned that it would take 2 hrs to get the results. But i got it after 3 hrs. The doctor took lunch break that time and so we need to wait a bit more for our turn. Not sure it happens with everytime.Tips:1. Book the appointment in the morning ( 9 to 11 am) itself so that the waiting time would be very less.2. Phone booking or online booking for the timeslot is not necessary. You can go directly and even if you book the appointment in advance it wont be much difference atall3. Be patient with your turn...I am giving 4/5 because of the doctor shiva narayana reddy sir service. Because thats what i need the most.",4.0,Telangana 500009,2 years ago

In my case the manager simply had no idea how the final bill was prepared and was taking multiple advice here and there from their colleagues and wasted our time.

Doctors in emergency were very kind but it was said that there were no beds in emergency room when we arrived hence we were made to wait for longer time.(0/10). I wonder what if it was life threatening emergency and still ppl had to wait. Similar thing hs happened with another patient there. Hence am not the only person to experience it.The most unprofessional and annoying part is that the canteen people don't knock door and directly jump into rooms which is felt like infringement of our space(0/10).

It is with great disappointment that I write this review, as the level of negligence displayed by the hospital staff during this crucial time was truly appalling. Not a single medical professional was there at night to monitor her progress, she was left in pain for 36 hours. There was a great life threat to my sister because of your negligence.Thank God, my Sister was out of danger. Dr. Sirisha confessed with my mother about the life threat to my Sister and Dr. Sirisha told my mom that they learned a lesson out my sister's case, WHAT WAS THAT?  are you guys doing practicals for real sitting out there.Remember you guys are not doing FREE SERVICE out there. We are being billed in lakhs of rupees (3.7lks you guys charged us), better put in your efforts to provide QUALITY service or hire better Professionals.In conclusion, our experience at Rainbow Hospital was nothing short of a nightmare.

My one month old baby was admitted in NICU in case of emergency for breathing difficulty. In NICU though i expressed my milk to feed him  by staying whole night as suggested by nurse. They gave my baby formula feed, and when he was shifted to Normal ward they sent me back all the expressed milk.When I asked them why the milk was not given they told me baby has slept till afternoon after taking formula and didn't woke up. They don't even have minimum knowledge that baby has to feed every 2 or 3 hour interval.After shifting to normal ward entire next night the baby was crying continuously as he was unable to take feed properly and we were not able to understand what the reason was and asked staff and nurse people to call doctor immediately or guide us what to do, they told they will call doctor but no one came back, we asked them multiple times to address our concern but they were giving excuses like it's normal for a baby to cry, as you are new mom you are worried too much and left the room ........how can excessive crying of baby for 3 hours is normal is what I didn't understand. Finally after 3 hours when we lost our patience and scolded the staff people as we were unable to see our baby's pain, as no one was helping us to stop the baby cry they called the emergency doctor and the doctor suggested to give colic aid as baby was suffering from excess gas and was not able to take feed.Doctors are good but the draw back is due to inexperienced staff members, nurse and improper management.

Over charging for everything, and if you question be ready to get answer ""Its hospital PROTOCOL"".3. Why do I have to give a letter in written to view / get medical test reports of my own baby before discharge? Why am I not authorized to view my baby's file during hospitalization?4. They will start your counseling with preferred doctor and without any intimation doctor leaves the hospital in your 36th week of pregnancy which leaves you surprised. Doctor & Hospital both does not care or see it important to update patient.5. Rude Staff. (Not all but few of them)6. Unhygienic washroom with no cleanliness.7. Pathetic dirty canteen.Dear Management,I seek answer, was hospital approach correct toward the treatment? Should I be charged a Lakh(approx) bill for a dehydration case?

Not one or 2 we have faced every day the worst experiences with them. Don't expect any kind of proper care that a corporate hospital can provide. Fairly speaking such a worst diet they gave to the baby's mother. Oil was floating on the curries. While discharge also they have taken blood sample of the 2days baby and neglected of forwarding the sample to the test and they don't even know where the sample is. And they have taken the sample twice again from the 2 days bord baby. Such a kindless, ruthless behaviour. If we have gone to some other hospital they would treat us better.Trust me don't go here.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Jerome Prashanth,Staff always delays appointments for ultrasound here by 2 hours minimum. If the delay is expected why do they give appointments? Which are clearly of no use. Seems like they are trying to fit more patients in a day than they can accommodate which is quite waste of time on both sides. Please change this so that you can serve more effectively rather than making people wait for 2-3 hours on every visit. It shouldn‚Äôt be a marketing technique to show others how busy you are by the number of people you make wait rather organise each day with limited patients and complete their appointments diligently.Hope this feedback works as it frustrates anyone who is just waiting due your unorganised appointments scheduling or any other marketing gimmicks that you can use while patients can opt for another facility who does their appointments on time and are more organised.Ultrasound technician seems to show her frustration on hospital people as well as patients who came for tests. THIS IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE. This clearly shows how poorly she or her team is trained. Please try to change this if possible. It maybe your day in and out and quite casual or normal but REMEMBER you are dealing with mothers-to-be and you can‚Äôt afford to ill treat them where you are supposed to be gentle. Again give enough time so that you will have patience to serve them better. Overloading yourself each day results in such frustration from your staff and on patients.GREAT HOSPITAL BUT HUMBLE REQUEST TO KINDLY CHANGE THESE THINGS IF POSSIBLE.Thank you,1.0,Telangana 500009,a year ago

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Pavan Kumar Yadlapally,"Following review is considering only COVID vaccination process:1) This hospital opens slots in thousands everyday, which is worth appreciation, because it has become very difficult for a common man to get vaccinated these days.2) The staff was very organized, well trained, systematic and followed a token method. They were able to guide people well, right from entering the hospital premises, filling the consent forms, payment and getting the jab.Following are some of the places where there is scope of improvement:1) Because of the long queues and the limited size of the tent arranged before the hospital, almost everyone will have to wait in blistering sun for around 25 minutes, this might not be a problem for young people but was definitely discomforting for the aged. It would be really help if the arrangements are made to extent the shade till the end of the lane where people wait. Monsoon has started and rain will cause additional problems.2) The number of people being sent in each batch should be strictly reduced to around 10, so that social distancing can also be maintained. This definitely would slightly increase the waiting times but it is worth considering to avoid sitting close to other people.3) There is no provision for people to wait for 30 minutes after taking the jab, which should be done as per protocol to make sure there are no side effects.Overall, I thank the hospital for enabling a smooth process and getting many people vaccinated.",5.0,Telangana 500009,2 years ago
"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Harika Karakata,"Had an consultation with one of the doctor in vikrampuri branch. The doctor there jumped the gun and gave over all prospective about our concern - which we understand. I wish she could have heard us a little more instead of only speaking with her experience about patients concerns, not all concerns have one solution to conclude. We visited one more doctor 15 mins prior to consulting you, his approach and his empathy was at par the best in rainbow. Make a checklist of all the things which are required to address a concern , instead of vaguely speaking with your experience. What irked me is , I said it was exhausting for me and my husband to takecare of household chores abroad , she imagined that as taking care of our kids and spoke as she likes. She also said third person should understand a child to converse well. With my experience all I can say is my child needs little empathy and love to mingle with others. Learn basic ethics of not letting anyone get into your consultation room when a private conversation is going on with patients. My husband and I thought of walking out of your room. We respected your consultation had we wish you did the same. You may be a little straight forward but you're wrong in saying things about concerns which don't exist in my child. That's why make a checklist to conclude.  We wasted our time visiting you. Keep your bookish knowledge for yourself.  When I open Google and type my concern i read the same what is the use of you being a qualified doctor when your answers are similar to Google. Our physicians abroad said never believe Google answers, I stand by their words. Get some practical experience before concluding. I think I have a better understanding and solution for our concerns than you. That's why I rate you less than a star.",1.0,Telangana 500009,a year ago

We were not aware that almost all of the deliveries done by her are C section. She will make you believe that normal delivery is not possible. I would definitely not recommend anyone to consult Dr. Bhavana kasu if you want to go for normal delivery. She will tell that she will do normal delivery but finally she will do c section because it is less hectic. My wife was having false labor in test she asked to admit immediately and said she is already is labor. When we asked her to wait as my wife was not having any pains, she scared us by saying their will be risks. After admitting also when my wife told she has no pains and questioned any they admitted her, then she forcefully broke my wife's water without giving her any chance to think(I was not there and she didn't even let my wife to talk to me about it by asking ""what will he do in this""). This left us with no choice but to delivery soon. They didn't even wait much time for normal delivery and finally had to go with c section. My wife is physically very fit, also she did so many exercises for normal delivery during her pregnancy.Lastly I want to tell everyone that doctors in India make us believe that normal delivery is very less possible now a days and its very difficult. There is nothing like that. Almost all deliveries in other counties are normal. How is that possible? Doctors in India don't care about the patients, they only care about their comfort and time. Doctors here knew that mother will forget all the pain she had gone through once she sees her baby. Choose your doctor wisely after a good research or go for hospitals like Fernandez where they do normal deliveries.

Whats the point of scheduling and coming at 11.15 for an appointment and then be told at 11.45 to wait more time... is idiotic. Especially when weve been saying that we've come for just a vaccination and all that is required by the doctor is check ... vaccination is to be given by the nurse. Other patients are being rescheduled in front of us and were constantly asked to wait for 2 more minutes. Have already had four.. yes 4 conversations with the reception and still waiting.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Sharon Dodda,"The most pathetic place. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Pregnant women are just money machines to them. Be aware. Writing this review after going to initial checkups, scans, the works and delivery in this hospital. Please avoid this place. I have left with nothing but a traumatic birth experience. I have every report and how it doesn't really match what I have witnessed in terms of the fetal health. Bunch of a grade liars who need to be dragged to court. Dr. Madhavi Reddy, a jackal in sheep's clothing. Watch out for that one. I was refused proper care and guidance during my most vulnerable state. I was asked to induce based on a risk that my baby had. I have not sought second opinion and blindly believed their words. The day of induction I was not given anema before hand, I was not given iv fluids either. I should have known it was a long game to them. After the first dose of inducing medicine, they said baby is experiencing irregular heart rate and I need c section. I sensed no change in my baby's behavior. Whatever reasons were given to me didn't require a c section. I refused. They shamed me. That I was putting my comfort over my baby's health. Madhavi made me sign a letter which she gave wrote that I'm responsible for anything that were to happen to my baby, death, brain damage etc. I signed it and my hubs as well. Btw this letter isn't in my file anymore. I was supposed to get my second dose at 9pm but had to go through this emotional blackmail and harassment until 12pm while I required an emergency c section according to them. Red flag anyone? There were so many red flags right from admission that I dismissed. After asking for the direction or guidance, I was told they were busy with another delivery. At around 12pm I got the second dose and pains started. They never checked the progress. I was getting closer to deliver at 3, begged for pain relief. Couldn't they sense I was closer?they choose to ignore the signs. I begged for epidural. I was given some medicine. Was told epidural can reduce my baby's heart .again asked if the babys in distress after we given epidural you have to sign consent for c section. I said okay. Then I get anema, mind you no one bothered to check my dilation. I was asked to use the washroom. The attender or Aya wouldn't let me move, I was in pain screaming, light-headed. My body was demanding me to push, and I did. Twice I felt the babys head. I screamed for my hubs and walked a bit to get out for help. He rushed in, the baby came out and luckily he caught her in his hands in the washroom. He screamed for help. Then they show up and help us. Saying what a healthy baby, no issues at all, so pretty. I delivered standing, walked to the bed to be stitched. Have been crying since that day unable to get over the event. Unable to move on. I was just a prey who got very lucky. Who stood her ground.

Nurses have the worst attitude. They are rude and have bad communication. Panicking patients are not provided proper support by nurses. They need to have someone to guide new moms to be motivated and strong. Women who come in early labor and are TPA are forced to stay back for unnecessary/made up reasons to probably let them end up having a C section. Doctors seem to instill fear of giving medicines to increase pain or hasten the delivery process instead of supporting natural course of birth. Not opting this hospital for my second child.

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Chalamacharla Madhavi,"No proper support. Generally doctors should go preliminary check up with stethoscope ,really if they are not able to trace the problem then they should go for any required tests. But these people won't prefer to do that, simply they will make you to scare of so many diseases prevailing in the season and go for all types of tests , x-ray and scanning corporate simply they behave like a leeches towards money. If you any genuine doubts for these doubts they will make you charge of scare means they will make you mentally unstable by informing very dangerous health issues. Example if your baby growth (weight)is comparable slow /less means they can suggest some medicine to gain weight , but they will make you to scare by saying there may be hole in heart  in your baby might be the reason your baby is not growing. That means again we need to go for scanning of heart immediately that is main reason behind that. Such a typical people you are going to face when you visit this hospital. They wont leave from months baby to  years baby with out blood test , x-ray etc., even if you visit for a minor reason unless until there corporate culture change.

We have consulted Dr. Bhavana Kasu all through. I am very happy and delighted to share that we had a wonderful experience with the hospital. Special thanks to Dr. Bhavana Kasu for her excellent care and perfect diagnosis. I would like to mention a specific incident here. My wife had some tightness in her abdomen when she was in her 39th week. We had come to the Dr and she has advised to have my wife admitted and suggested the course of actions for a normal delivery. But she also wanted to break the fluid once (to check the color). If the color is GREEN then it indicates that the baby inside is in stress and did potty inside (due to stress). It would then be risky to continue as the baby might swallow the potty, which would lead to further complications and risk to baby. In our case as well, it was GREEN in color. So, as it would be risky to continue further, it was decided to go for a C section. The point to note here is that it was purely Dr. Bhavana Kasu's timely and thoughtful action (to break the fluid) which really made the delivery smooth and avoided any risk to the baby. Both baby and mother are quite well today. This is just one instance to quote about Dr. Bhavana Kasu. She is truely amazing.

Well, I was going on from counter and waiting rooms until I arrived at the vaccination cabin (no 3) where the situation was (I don't know what should I say)! So this guy took up a syringe (with the needle exposed) and accidentally it fell down on the floor Then came the frightening part. The guy was about to inject me with that syringe only! On complaining the guy just said "" BHAIYA, KUCH NAHI HOGA!"" and was reluctant to change the syringe! He did so on forcing and when I said would they take the risk if I get some other infection! No nothing followed. No sanitization of chairs, all the COVID protocols are a joke! I think they should have a catchphrase: ""I GOT THE VACCINE, AHAM BRAHMASMI.""

"Rainbow Children's Hospital and BirthRight, Karkhana, Secunderabad, Best Maternity Hospital",Rashmi Arni,"I started showing here from the 1st day of my pregnancy, the doctor had advised me on taking a scan called "" NT Scan"" which is done to determine the risk of down syndrome in the baby, this is determined by doing a scan and a blood test during the 11-14 weeks of pregnancy. But here they took a blood test during 9th week and asked me to come back for a scan during my 11th week , which I did , and I was told that I come under High risk zone ( 1: 52 ) for downs in my baby and they further asked us to go in for a few more tests which were really expensive and that's we realised there must be something fishy. So  We wanted a second opinion and we consulted other experienced doctors, we came to know the tests had been wrongly conducted, the hospital had to do the scan first and then blood test and not the other way round as in my case, and also the blood test should have been done between 11-14 weeks , which in my case was done in the 9th week, and most important there was a long gap between the blood test and the scan more than 10 days, but there cannot be more than 2 days gap, all these resulted in wrong report, when the test was repeated in another place the report was negative. This whole procedure put us through lot of stress and mental trauma , this is a lesson to everyone, please don't trust your doctor blindly, go in for multiple opinions if you find anything fishy, I fail to understand how a reputed hospital with experienced doctors can be soo careless .",2.0,Telangana 500009,7 years ago
